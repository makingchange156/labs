## Overview
# 🧪 Maclifeinc Lab  
### Applied AI • Machine Learning • Experimental Systems

Maclifeinc Lab is a sandbox for building, testing, and breaking emerging AI technologies.  
We explore practical machine learning, automation, and experimental software systems with a focus on rapid prototyping and open research.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus Areas
- **Neural network experimentation**  
- **LLM tooling & automation**
- **AI agents & workflow orchestration**
- **Data engineering pipelines**
- **Model evaluation & benchmarking**

---

## 🧠 Active Projects
- **AI Agents** — autonomous task runners and workflow systems  
- **Model Playground** — experiments with transformers, RNNs, and hybrid architectures  
- **Data Tools** — preprocessing, augmentation, and dataset utilities  
- **Automation Scripts** — applied ML for real‑world tasks  

*(I can fill these in with real repo links once you share them.)*
